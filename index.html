		<div>In a nutshell
This is an app that lets you add text to long exposure photos. You write a message, choose a colour and select a font - and then drag your phone across the frame. Simple.

How to use it
• Type your message

• Choose a colour

• Pick a font

• Press the 'go' button to get a 3 second countdown.

• Press your shutter release and steadily slide your phone from right to left

Getting the best results
• LiteRite works best in low light. You're unlikely to see anything in daylight shots.

• Keep your message short. Preferrably less than 30 characters. If you need more than that, we'd recommend writing a letter.

• Keep your camera steady. In fact, use a tripod if you can. Or place your camera on something solid.

• Focus your camera on the phone's screen. Otherwise your writing will come out blurred. And try to keep the phone at this distance while you move it.

• Move the phone steadily. You'll probably need to experiment with the speed. If you move it too slow, the text will appear condensed. If you move it too fast, the text will appear stretched. Aim for that mother bear speed - the one that's just right.

• Experiment! I wrote this app and it took me a while to get it right. Even now, only one in five shots is good enough. It's a mix of choreography and random chance.

Common problems
I'm not seeing anything on my photosThe LiteRIte effect only works in low light. And it works best in near-darkness. Too much light is the most common problem. But it could also be that you're getting the timing wrong. Or you're doing it out of frame. Or there's something up with your phone. If it turns out that it's our fault, we're sorry. But not that sorry because we gave you this for free.

The text is blocky or distortedThat's down to your phone, I'm afraid. Techie factors like its CPU clock speed, its screen refresh rate, its graphic processor and other items of nerdification will affect the performance. Just accept these blocky artefacts as hipster glitch-art. They're soooooooo in right now. Like, totally.

My picture is all blurredThat's the thing about long-exposure shots - you have to keep your camera totally steady. Use a tripod. Or, at the very least, prop your camera on something solid. If your alcohol-induced shakes aren't the problem, it could just be that you're focusing on the wrong part of the shot. Set your focal distance to where your going to be light writing, if you can.


My screen flips from portrait to landscapeYou'll probably want to lock the orientation of your phone. If you don't know how to do that, ask Cap'n Google.

I've got blood in my stoolSee a doctor. That's got nothing to do with this app.

		<div>></div>
		<div>Obviously you're going to need two phones; one running the LiteRite app and the other with a long exposure photo app.

You'll probably find a couple of free options if you search your app store for 'long exposure' apps. Personally, I like to use 'Slow Shutter Camera +' on my iPhone.
Some handy tips
• Put the phone you're using as a camera on something solid to steady it. You don't want it to move while you're capturing the shot. The steadier you keep it, the better the shot.

• Set the exposure time between 2 and 4 seconds. 

• Take your picture and share it with the world with the hashtag #LiteRite !

		<div>The better you know your camera, the better your results will be. You may need to consult your user manual - or Google - to fiddle with the right settings.
Some handy tips

• Find out how to change the shutter speed. You need to set it somewhere between 2 and 4 seconds.

* Put your camera on a tripod. It's got to be totally still. Just holding it steady won't give very good results. You should also use a shutter release cable or remote control. 

• Take a gazillion shots. 

• Pick the best one and give it some Photoshop sparkle before sharing it with the world using the #LiteRite hashtag.
