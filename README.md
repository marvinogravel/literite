An HTML app to let you write on long exposure photos

---

Hi there,

You'll need a camera or another smartphone to capture your light writing. Probably with an exposure time of 2 to 5 seconds.

Then you write your message, pick and colour and select a font.

When you hit 'go' it gives you a countdown, you hit the shutter release just before the animation starts and move the phone across the shot.

Voila, light writing.

You can see some examples on Instagram under the hashtage #literite

I'm sharing it on Github and then exporting it as native smartphone apps using Adobe Phonegap.

Hopefully.

This is my first time doing this so it's all trial and error.

Wish me luck!

Dave
